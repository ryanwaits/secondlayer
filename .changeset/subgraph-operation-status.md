Expose subgraph operation status so agents can poll a reindex/backfill to completion instead of guessing. `reindex`/`backfill`/`stop` already return an `operationId`; now `GET /api/subgraphs/:name/operations/:id` returns that operation's live status (kind, status, processed blocks, a derived 0–1 progress, error, timestamps), and `GET /api/subgraphs/:name/operations` lists recent operations. Surfaced as `sl.subgraphs.getOperation(name, id)` / `sl.subgraphs.operations(name)` (SDK) and the `subgraphs_operation` MCP tool. Backed by the existing `subgraph_operations` table — no migration.
