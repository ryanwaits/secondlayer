Ship-ready workflow polish: versioning, rollback, bulk ops, and idempotent deploys.

- **Versioned handler bundles.** `POST /api/workflows` now writes `data/workflows/{name}-{version}.js` (exported `bumpPatch` from `@secondlayer/shared`). The runner already reads `handler_path` from the row so in-flight runs finish on their original bundle while new runs pick up the latest. The route opportunistically prunes on-disk bundles to the most recent 3 versions after every deploy.
- **Rollback.** New `POST /api/workflows/:name/rollback` route picks a prior on-disk bundle (or the specified `toVersion`), re-publishes it as a new patch version for audit, and refreshes `handler_path`. SDK `workflows.rollback()`, MCP `workflows_rollback`, and a web `rollback_workflow` HIL session tool (re-using the existing action card) are all wired up.
- **Bulk pause + cancel run.** `POST /api/workflows/pause-all` pauses every active workflow in the account (and disables their `workflow_schedules` rows). `POST /api/workflows/runs/:runId/cancel` marks a running / pending run as cancelled and removes any queue entry. Exposed via `workflows.pauseAll()` / `workflows.cancelRun()` and new `workflows_pause_all` / `workflows_cancel_run` MCP tools.
- **Idempotent deploy.** `DeployWorkflowRequestSchema` gained a `clientRequestId` field. The API keeps a 30-second in-memory cache keyed by `(apiKeyId, clientRequestId)` and replays the previous response on a repeat POST. The chat deploy card sends `deploy-${toolCallId}`, and the edit card sends `edit-${expectedVersion}-${name}` so double-clicks and accidental re-confirms don't double-deploy.
- **Workflow detail → chat.** The `/workflows/[name]` page now has an **Open in chat** CTA that navigates to a fresh session pre-seeded with `Read the workflow "{name}" and show me its source so I can edit it.`
