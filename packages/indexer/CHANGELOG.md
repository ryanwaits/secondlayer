### Major Changes

- [#13](https://github.com/ryanwaits/secondlayer/pull/13) [`2d61e78`](https://github.com/ryanwaits/secondlayer/commit/2d61e7822ee2b1dee28bdbccf92f1837c0fd05e5) Thanks [@ryanwaits](https://github.com/ryanwaits)! - Remove the streams product feature (real-time webhook deliveries) across the entire stack. Streams have been deprecated in favor of workflows + subgraphs.

  **Breaking changes:**

  - **SDK**: `client.streams.*` removed. `@secondlayer/sdk/streams` subpath export removed. `WorkflowSummary.triggerType` no longer accepts `"stream"`.
  - **CLI**: `sl streams *` commands removed (new, register, ls, get, set, logs, replay, rotate-secret, delete). `sl receiver`, `sl setup` commands removed. `sl status` / `sl doctor` no longer show stream/queue sections. `--wait` stop flags no longer drain a job queue.
  - **MCP**: `streams_*` tools removed. `workflows_scaffold` no longer accepts `type: "stream"` triggers. Stream filter MCP resource renamed to "event filter".
  - **API**: `/api/streams*` routes removed. `/api/logs/:id/stream` SSE endpoint removed. `/api/admin/stats` no longer returns `totalStreams`. `/api/accounts/usage` no longer returns `current.streams`. `/api/status` no longer returns queue/stream counts.
  - **Shared**: `StreamsTable`, `StreamMetricsTable`, `JobsTable`, `DeliveriesTable` dropped from `Database` interface. `@secondlayer/shared/queue` and `@secondlayer/shared/queue/recovery` subpaths removed. `@secondlayer/shared/db/queries/metrics` removed. `StreamNotFoundError` renamed to `NotFoundError`. `StreamsError` base class renamed to `SecondLayerError`. Dead subclasses `DeliveryError` and `FilterEvaluationError` removed. `StreamFilter` / `StreamFilterSchema` renamed to `EventFilter` / `EventFilterSchema`. `incrementDeliveries` removed (dead — no callers). `PlanLimits.streams` removed from `FREE_PLAN`.
  - **Worker**: stream processor, delivery dispatcher, signing, tracking, rate-limiter, and matcher all removed. Worker now runs only the scheduled storage-measurement job.
  - **Scaffold**: `generateStreamConfig` removed. Workflow trigger type no longer accepts `"stream"`.
  - **Workflows**: `StreamTrigger` type removed from `WorkflowTrigger` union.
  - **Workflow runner**: only `event` and `schedule` triggers are matched now.
  - **DB migration #32**: drops `streams`, `stream_metrics`, `jobs`, and `deliveries` tables. Renames PG NOTIFY channel from `streams:new_job` to `indexer:new_block`.

  **Bug fixes:**

  - CLI receiver was reading the wrong signature header (`x-streams-signature`) while the worker ships `X-Secondlayer-Signature`. The entire receiver is now removed.
  - Workflow scaffold paths (SDK + MCP + sessions) were emitting `type: "stream"` triggers that no longer typecheck against the workflows package.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- fix(subgraphs): expose resultHex in contract_call handler payload

  Adds `resultHex` (raw hex string) to the contract_call event payload so handlers can store the unmodified transaction result. Previously only the decoded Clarity object was available, causing `String(result)` to produce `[object Object]`.

  fix(indexer): normalize Hiro API function_args to hex strings

  Parser fallback now extracts `.hex` from `{hex,repr,name,type}` objects returned by the Hiro API, ensuring function_args are stored as hex strings consistently across all backfill sources.
