// live objects, no functions, no transaction handle, no secrets — only
// plain, structured-clone-safe data (BigInt included — Bun's `postMessage`
// structured-clones BigInt natively, verified empirically before relying on
// it here).

/**
 * One decided write, in the exact shape the host replays it: the real ctx
 * method name + the exact arguments a handler passed it, plus the tx meta
 * that was current when the handler queued it. The host reconstructs the
 * real `WriteOp` (and therefore the real SQL) by `hostCtx.setTx(op.tx)`
 * then `hostCtx[method](table, ...args)` on its own live `SubgraphContext`
 * — the host's ctx methods are the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for op
 * construction (spike doc §3.2/§4: "flush() … host replays each op onto a
 * real SubgraphContext and calls the real flush()"). `tx` matters because
 * `insert`/`upsert`/`increment` capture `_tx_id` at call time
 * (context.ts:130/160/239) — replaying without it would stamp every row
 * with the block's initial (empty) tx meta instead of the tx that produced
 * it. This shape is intentionally NOT the internal `WriteOp`
 * `{kind,data,set}` shape context.ts uses privately — that shape embeds
 * control keys that only make sense once reconstructed by the real methods.
