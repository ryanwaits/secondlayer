# @secondlayer/shared

## 0.12.3

### Patch Changes

- Add waitlist query functions (listWaitlist, getWaitlistById, approveWaitlistEntry) and admin constants export

## 0.12.2

### Patch Changes

- fix schema diff false positives from JSONB key reordering; hot-reload handler code after redeploy; handle bigint in jsonb serialization

## 0.12.1

### Patch Changes

- fix(subgraphs): complete accountId migration across deployer, marketplace, ownership

  Removes remaining apiKeyId fallbacks introduced in the Sprint 1 account-scoping change:

  - deployer.ts: getSubgraph lookup no longer falls back to apiKeyId
  - marketplace.ts: fork collision check and schema prefix use accountId
  - ownership.ts: assertSubgraphOwnership checks account_id instead of api_key_id
  - deleteSubgraph: uses accountId parameter consistently

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- feat(subgraphs): smart deploy — auto-versioning, auto-reindex, schema diff

  - System now owns versioning: patch auto-increments on every deploy (1.0.0 → 1.0.1); use --version flag for intentional bumps
  - Breaking schema changes auto-trigger reindex — no --reindex flag needed
  - Deploy output shows schema diff (added tables/columns, breaking changes, new version)
  - version field removed from schema hash so version bumps don't look like schema changes
  - --force flag skips reindex confirmation prompt
  - Handler code persisted in DB so container restarts don't break in-flight reindexes (migration 0029)

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- feat(subgraphs): account-wide subgraph scoping

  Subgraphs are now scoped at the account level rather than per API key. Any API key on the same account can deploy and update the same named subgraph without creating duplicates. Includes migration 0028 which adds `account_id` to the subgraphs table and renames existing PG schemas to use account prefix instead of key prefix.

  **Breaking for self-hosted:** Run migration 0028 before deploying. Stop the subgraph processor before running the migration (it renames live PG schemas).

## 0.10.1

### Patch Changes

- 885662d: feat(subgraphs): named-object sources with SubgraphFilter discriminated union

  Breaking: sources changed from `SubgraphSource[]` to `Record<string, SubgraphFilter>`. Handler keys are now source names, not derived sourceKey strings. Event data auto-unwrapped via cvToValue. New context methods: patch, patchOrInsert, formatUnits, aggregates.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- Deploy-resilient reindexing: abort support, auto-resume on startup, graceful shutdown, and `sl subgraphs stop` command.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes
