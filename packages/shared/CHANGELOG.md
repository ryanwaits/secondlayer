# @secondlayer/shared

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#13](https://github.com/ryanwaits/secondlayer/pull/13) [`2d61e78`](https://github.com/ryanwaits/secondlayer/commit/2d61e7822ee2b1dee28bdbccf92f1837c0fd05e5) Thanks [@ryanwaits](https://github.com/ryanwaits)! - Remove the streams product feature (real-time webhook deliveries) across the entire stack. Streams have been deprecated in favor of workflows + subgraphs.

  **Breaking changes:**

  - **SDK**: `client.streams.*` removed. `@secondlayer/sdk/streams` subpath export removed. `WorkflowSummary.triggerType` no longer accepts `"stream"`.
  - **CLI**: `sl streams *` commands removed (new, register, ls, get, set, logs, replay, rotate-secret, delete). `sl receiver`, `sl setup` commands removed. `sl status` / `sl doctor` no longer show stream/queue sections. `--wait` stop flags no longer drain a job queue.
  - **MCP**: `streams_*` tools removed. `workflows_scaffold` no longer accepts `type: "stream"` triggers. Stream filter MCP resource renamed to "event filter".
  - **API**: `/api/streams*` routes removed. `/api/logs/:id/stream` SSE endpoint removed. `/api/admin/stats` no longer returns `totalStreams`. `/api/accounts/usage` no longer returns `current.streams`. `/api/status` no longer returns queue/stream counts.
  - **Shared**: `StreamsTable`, `StreamMetricsTable`, `JobsTable`, `DeliveriesTable` dropped from `Database` interface. `@secondlayer/shared/queue` and `@secondlayer/shared/queue/recovery` subpaths removed. `@secondlayer/shared/db/queries/metrics` removed. `StreamNotFoundError` renamed to `NotFoundError`. `StreamsError` base class renamed to `SecondLayerError`. Dead subclasses `DeliveryError` and `FilterEvaluationError` removed. `StreamFilter` / `StreamFilterSchema` renamed to `EventFilter` / `EventFilterSchema`. `incrementDeliveries` removed (dead — no callers). `PlanLimits.streams` removed from `FREE_PLAN`.
  - **Worker**: stream processor, delivery dispatcher, signing, tracking, rate-limiter, and matcher all removed. Worker now runs only the scheduled storage-measurement job.
  - **Scaffold**: `generateStreamConfig` removed. Workflow trigger type no longer accepts `"stream"`.
  - **Workflows**: `StreamTrigger` type removed from `WorkflowTrigger` union.
  - **Workflow runner**: only `event` and `schedule` triggers are matched now.
  - **DB migration #32**: drops `streams`, `stream_metrics`, `jobs`, and `deliveries` tables. Renames PG NOTIFY channel from `streams:new_job` to `indexer:new_block`.

  **Bug fixes:**

  - CLI receiver was reading the wrong signature header (`x-streams-signature`) while the worker ships `X-Secondlayer-Signature`. The entire receiver is now removed.
  - Workflow scaffold paths (SDK + MCP + sessions) were emitting `type: "stream"` triggers that no longer typecheck against the workflows package.

### Patch Changes

- [`b4a4bf1`](https://github.com/ryanwaits/secondlayer/commit/b4a4bf186d59edb29fbde7ffd8d8273d6390c7e9) Thanks [@ryanwaits](https://github.com/ryanwaits)! - Server-side subgraph bundler + source capture, mirroring the workflows authoring loop.

  - **API**: new `POST /api/subgraphs/bundle` runs `bundleSubgraphCode` from `@secondlayer/bundler` and returns `{ name, version, sources, schema, handlerCode, sourceCode, bundleSize }`. `BundleSizeError → 413`, other failures → 400 with `code: "BUNDLE_FAILED"`. New `GET /api/subgraphs/:name/source` returns the original TypeScript source for deployed subgraphs, or a `readOnly` payload for rows predating the migration. `POST /api/subgraphs` now threads `sourceCode` through `deploySchema` so the original source is persisted on deploy.
  - **SDK**: new `subgraphs.bundle({ code })` and `subgraphs.getSource(name)` methods + `BundleSubgraphResponse` / `SubgraphSource` types.
  - **shared**: migration `0031_subgraph_source_code` adds `source_code TEXT NULL` to the `subgraphs` table; `registerSubgraph` upsert + `DeploySubgraphRequest` schema both accept an optional `sourceCode` field (max 1MB).
  - **subgraphs**: `deploySchema()` accepts `sourceCode` in its options and forwards it to `registerSubgraph`.

  Unlocks the next wave of the chat authoring loop (read/edit/deploy/tail subgraphs in a session).

- [`f1b6725`](https://github.com/ryanwaits/secondlayer/commit/f1b67257d9d6eae413ea1f49c779522205a68fc7) Thanks [@ryanwaits](https://github.com/ryanwaits)! - - Introduce `@secondlayer/bundler`: shared esbuild + validate helpers (`bundleSubgraphCode`, `bundleWorkflowCode`) with typed `BundleSizeError` and per-kind caps (subgraphs 4 MB, workflows 1 MB). MCP and CLI now consume it instead of inlining esbuild.

  - Persist workflow TypeScript source alongside the compiled handler (`workflow_definitions.source_code`, migration `0030`). `upsertWorkflowDefinition` bumps the patch version on every update and throws `VersionConflictError` when `expectedVersion` does not match the stored row.
  - Extend `DeployWorkflowRequestSchema` and the SDK/CLI deploy path with `sourceCode` + `expectedVersion`, so `sl workflows deploy` populates the new column and surfaces conflict detection.

- [`38e62e7`](https://github.com/ryanwaits/secondlayer/commit/38e62e74e600c353884fc89a5e22b8840a4d2689) Thanks [@ryanwaits](https://github.com/ryanwaits)! - - `POST /api/workflows` now maps `VersionConflictError` to HTTP 409 `{ error, code, currentVersion, expectedVersion }`, reads `x-sl-origin: cli|mcp|session` for telemetry, and logs every deploy. The response body now includes the resolved `version`.

  - Added `dryRun: true` mode on `POST /api/workflows` — validates the bundle via data-URI import, skips disk and DB writes, and returns `{ valid, validation, bundleSize }`.
  - Added `GET /api/workflows/:name/source` — returns `{ name, version, sourceCode, readOnly, updatedAt }`, with a `readOnly: true` degradation for workflows deployed before source capture.
  - SDK: `Workflows.deploy()` accepts `expectedVersion` and `dryRun` and throws a typed `VersionConflictError` on 409. `Workflows.getSource(name)` fetches the stored source. Every SDK request sends `x-sl-origin` (default `cli`, overridable via `new SecondLayer({ origin })`). `ApiError` now preserves the parsed response body.
  - MCP: new `workflows_deploy` tool (bundles via `@secondlayer/bundler`, sets `x-sl-origin: mcp`, surfaces bundler errors verbatim, supports `expectedVersion` + `dryRun`), `workflows_get_definition` (returns stored TypeScript source), and `workflows_delete`.

- [`e9c298c`](https://github.com/ryanwaits/secondlayer/commit/e9c298c828770e8ff538b957a7d7f38a7753900f) Thanks [@ryanwaits](https://github.com/ryanwaits)! - Ship-ready workflow polish: versioning, rollback, bulk ops, and idempotent deploys.

  - **Versioned handler bundles.** `POST /api/workflows` now writes `data/workflows/{name}-{version}.js` (exported `bumpPatch` from `@secondlayer/shared`). The runner already reads `handler_path` from the row so in-flight runs finish on their original bundle while new runs pick up the latest. The route opportunistically prunes on-disk bundles to the most recent 3 versions after every deploy.
  - **Rollback.** New `POST /api/workflows/:name/rollback` route picks a prior on-disk bundle (or the specified `toVersion`), re-publishes it as a new patch version for audit, and refreshes `handler_path`. SDK `workflows.rollback()`, MCP `workflows_rollback`, and a web `rollback_workflow` HIL session tool (re-using the existing action card) are all wired up.
  - **Bulk pause + cancel run.** `POST /api/workflows/pause-all` pauses every active workflow in the account (and disables their `workflow_schedules` rows). `POST /api/workflows/runs/:runId/cancel` marks a running / pending run as cancelled and removes any queue entry. Exposed via `workflows.pauseAll()` / `workflows.cancelRun()` and new `workflows_pause_all` / `workflows_cancel_run` MCP tools.
  - **Idempotent deploy.** `DeployWorkflowRequestSchema` gained a `clientRequestId` field. The API keeps a 30-second in-memory cache keyed by `(apiKeyId, clientRequestId)` and replays the previous response on a repeat POST. The chat deploy card sends `deploy-${toolCallId}`, and the edit card sends `edit-${expectedVersion}-${name}` so double-clicks and accidental re-confirms don't double-deploy.
  - **Workflow detail → chat.** The `/workflows/[name]` page now has an **Open in chat** CTA that navigates to a fresh session pre-seeded with `Read the workflow "{name}" and show me its source so I can edit it.`

## 0.12.3

### Patch Changes

- Add waitlist query functions (listWaitlist, getWaitlistById, approveWaitlistEntry) and admin constants export

## 0.12.2

### Patch Changes

- fix schema diff false positives from JSONB key reordering; hot-reload handler code after redeploy; handle bigint in jsonb serialization

## 0.12.1

### Patch Changes

- fix(subgraphs): complete accountId migration across deployer, marketplace, ownership

  Removes remaining apiKeyId fallbacks introduced in the Sprint 1 account-scoping change:

  - deployer.ts: getSubgraph lookup no longer falls back to apiKeyId
  - marketplace.ts: fork collision check and schema prefix use accountId
  - ownership.ts: assertSubgraphOwnership checks account_id instead of api_key_id
  - deleteSubgraph: uses accountId parameter consistently

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- feat(subgraphs): smart deploy — auto-versioning, auto-reindex, schema diff

  - System now owns versioning: patch auto-increments on every deploy (1.0.0 → 1.0.1); use --version flag for intentional bumps
  - Breaking schema changes auto-trigger reindex — no --reindex flag needed
  - Deploy output shows schema diff (added tables/columns, breaking changes, new version)
  - version field removed from schema hash so version bumps don't look like schema changes
  - --force flag skips reindex confirmation prompt
  - Handler code persisted in DB so container restarts don't break in-flight reindexes (migration 0029)

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- feat(subgraphs): account-wide subgraph scoping

  Subgraphs are now scoped at the account level rather than per API key. Any API key on the same account can deploy and update the same named subgraph without creating duplicates. Includes migration 0028 which adds `account_id` to the subgraphs table and renames existing PG schemas to use account prefix instead of key prefix.

  **Breaking for self-hosted:** Run migration 0028 before deploying. Stop the subgraph processor before running the migration (it renames live PG schemas).

## 0.10.1

### Patch Changes

- 885662d: feat(subgraphs): named-object sources with SubgraphFilter discriminated union

  Breaking: sources changed from `SubgraphSource[]` to `Record<string, SubgraphFilter>`. Handler keys are now source names, not derived sourceKey strings. Event data auto-unwrapped via cvToValue. New context methods: patch, patchOrInsert, formatUnits, aggregates.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- Deploy-resilient reindexing: abort support, auto-resume on startup, graceful shutdown, and `sl subgraphs stop` command.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- e274333: fix(subgraphs): use highest_seen_block ceiling and add startBlock support

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes
